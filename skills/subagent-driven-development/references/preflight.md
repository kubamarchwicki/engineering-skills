# The Pre-flight Scan

Part of subagent-driven-development. Run it once, before
dispatching Task 1.

Before dispatching Task 1, scan the plan once for conflicts, writing down
what you checked as you check it:

- tasks that contradict each other or the plan's Global Constraints
- anything the plan explicitly mandates that the review rubric treats as a
  defect (a test that asserts nothing, verbatim duplication of a logic block)

The scan's output is a table, not a verdict. One row for every pair of tasks
that share a file or an interface: the two tasks, what one produces against
what the other consumes, and what you found. One row for every task: whether
its own text agrees with itself — the tests it specifies against the code it
specifies, the files it creates against the files it later touches. "The scan
is clean" without those rows is not a scan you ran.

Write the table to the ledger and record Provisional interfaces as unresolved
dependencies. Investigate each finding; update routine inconsistencies in the
plan, and obtain the user decision for consequential conflicts before affected
work proceeds. Dispatch only semantically Ready tasks. The review loop remains
the net for conflicts that only emerge from implementation.
